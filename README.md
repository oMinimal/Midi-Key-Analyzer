# The Midi Key Analyzer lets you find the key of ~~any~~ ~~most~~ some midi files!
## Features
* Enable and disable tracks for better accuracy.
* Visualize selected patterns.
* Play the midi.

## Setup
1. Extract the files.
2. Run 'Midi Key Analyzer.exe'.
3. Enjoy!

**NOTES:**
* The user requires .NET Core 3.1 or higher.
* At this point it doesn't support quite all midi files. I'm still working out the kinks.
* This is just a hobby project ;P

**LIBRARIES:**

This program uses the _DryWetMIDI_ and the _OxyPlot_ .NET libraries, both of which are wonderful to use!
